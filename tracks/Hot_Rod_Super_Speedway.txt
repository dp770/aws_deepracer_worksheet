Hot Rod Super Speedway
The Hot Rod Super Speedway adds pro difficulty to the short track counterpart. With a length of 59.69m, the speed loving arch is replaced by 4 short straightaways coupled with variable angle turns. Skillful racers may bisect the chicanes to extending speed generating opportunities and pull away from the pack.
