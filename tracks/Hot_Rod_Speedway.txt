Hot Rod Speedway
Featuring a short length of just 42.25m, the Hot Rod Speedway caters to speed loving dragsters with multiple fast running drag strips tied together by friendly sweeping turns. Expect to see blistering fast times this month as models rev their engines and burn rubber around this track.
