At 65.18m, The Baja Highway extends upon the shorter turnpike with pro level difficulty and even more opportunities for generating speed. A second massive straightaway mid course is similarly capped by a hairpin and increasing radius turn, along with an unforgiving technical section full of wrought with tight cutbacks and hairpins.
