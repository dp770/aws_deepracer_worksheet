Vivalas Speedway
Inspired by a historic Las Vegas track of yesteryear, the Vivalas Speedway is the second longest, and most difficult track to be released in 2021. 5 consecutive opposing hairpins are framed in by the Vivalas Loop perimeter; a modified oval full of high speed straightaways primed for passing and all out speed. Which racers will go all in and gamble it all for the jackpot?
