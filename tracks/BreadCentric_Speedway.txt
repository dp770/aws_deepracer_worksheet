BreadCentric Speedway
The BreadCentric Speedway is named after AWS DeepRacer Community Hero, Tomasz Ptak AKA "BreadCentric". This track adds a deceivingly technical section with an unforgiving hairpin turn separating the varying dragstrips. The BreadCentric Speedway will test the skills of even the most experienced developer.
