Baja Turnpike
At 40.79m, the Baja Turnpike is a short angular track that mixes full throttle straightaways with hard decelerating turns. Signature features include a long high speed sprint over the finish line end capped by a harsh hairpin and tight 90 degree turn. While you won't find any sand traps on this course there are no shortage of places to get stuck.
